In My  HomeWork:


I used KWArrayList for customer automation system (for keeping data in customer's methods).

I used the KWLinkedList to keep the amount of products stored in the Branches (as a two dimension arraylist) 
and the information (name, surname, e-mail, password) of employees and administrators in the Branches.

I didn't make the HybridList class.
